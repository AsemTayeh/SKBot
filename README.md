# **SKB-4 (Smart Komodo Bot-4)**  

SKB-4 is a GPT-powered Discord bot with **channel-specific context management** and **integrated weather reporting**. It handles conversations efficiently by maintaining a history of recent messages and reducing unnecessary API calls through smart token management.  


## **Features Overview**  

- **Per-Channel Message History**:  
  - Stores the last **20 messages per channel** using a global array.             
  - Automatically removes the oldest message when the history limit is reached.

- **Weather API Integration**:  
  - Uses an external weather API to provide **live weather data** (temperature, time zone) when requested for a specific city.  
  - Implements error handling to provide fallback responses when the API fails.

- **GPT-Based Responses**:  
  - Integrates with **OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini** model to generate replies based on message context.  
  - Sends the **latest message and relevant history** to maintain conversation flow.  

- **Channel Filtering**:  
  - Responds only in **authorized channels** listed via environment variables.  
  - Uses **channel ID filtering** to maintain separate conversation threads for different channels.  

- **Token Usage Optimization**:  
  - Requires **`@SKB-4` mention** to trigger responses, preventing unnecessary token consumption.  
  - Ignores messages from other bots.
